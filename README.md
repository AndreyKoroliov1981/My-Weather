# My-Weather
An application for finding out the weather in the city.

# Install
You have to copy the files to your computer and open with Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA and run the project.

# Usage
To clarify the weather in the city, you need to type the name of the city in the search box in the Search tab (or at least a few letters). If there is no access to the Internet, the application will try to get data from the database. Information about saved cities is located on the City tab. When you select a city, a weather information window will open.
